# CovidPredictor

This is a corona virus predictor DL app,where in if one uploads an image of the chest-X-ray,the model can predict whether the person has corona virus or not..It's a Convolution neural network model which i used as the backend and the front end is made using bootstarp and flask..i've also used the PIL library to resize the image to 224,224 size..that's given in the "selection.ipynb" file,i've also added the transfer learning file ,where i used VGG16 model 
could'nt deploy it to heroku as it restricted the slug size and the HDF5 file is about 325MB so could'nt import it as per he guide lines of Github
