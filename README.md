# CovidPredictor

this is an corona virus predictor DL app,it's a Convolution neural network model and the front end is made using bootstarp and flask..i've also used the PIL library to resize the image to 224,224 size ..that's given in the "selection.ipynb" file
could'nt deploy it to heroku as it restricted the slug size and the HDF5 file is about 325MB so could'nt import it as per he guide lines of Github
downlaod the entire dataset from here:
